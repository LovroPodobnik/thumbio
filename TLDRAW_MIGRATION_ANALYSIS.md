## Proposed Architecture: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Core Migration
```
Current PixiJS Canvas â†’ tldraw Editor
â”œâ”€â”€ YouTube Thumbnails â†’ Custom ThumbnailShape
â”œâ”€â”€ Text Labels â†’ Enhanced Text shapes  
â”œâ”€â”€ Comments â†’ Custom PinShape
â”œâ”€â”€ Basic Drawing â†’ Draw tool + custom brushes
â””â”€â”€ Selection â†’ Custom SelectTool with multi-mode
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
```
Complex Features â†’ Custom tldraw Extensions
â”œâ”€â”€ Performance Badges â†’ ThumbnailShape overlays
â”œâ”€â”€ Drawing Layers â†’ Shape ordering system
â”œâ”€â”€ Locked States â†’ Custom interaction handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ Tool Coordination â†’ State bridge implementation
â””â”€â”€ Keyboard Shortcuts â†’ Custom event handlers
```

## Custom Shape Implementations Required

### 1. ThumbnailShape
```typescript
type ThumbnailShape = TLBaseShape<'thumbnail', {
  url: string
  videoId: string
  channelName: string
  metrics: {
    views: number
    engagement: number
    isViral: boolean
  }
  locked: boolean
  w: number
  h: number
}>
```

### 2. PinShape (Comments)
```typescript
type PinShape = TLBaseShape<'pin', {
  content: string
  resolved: boolean
  author: string
  timestamp: number
}>
```

### 3. ChannelHeaderShape
```typescript
type ChannelHeaderShape = TLBaseShape<'channelHeader', {
  channelName: string
  isSystemGenerated: boolean
  style: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'xl'
}>
```

## Custom Tools Required

### 1. YouTubeThumbnailTool
- Handles thumbnail-specific interactions
- Manages locked/unlocked states
- Integrates with YouTube API data

### 2. LayeredDrawTool
- Extends built-in draw tool
- Manages foreground/background drawing
- Handles eraser mode

### 3. CommentPinTool
- Places comment pins on canvas
- Manages pin resolution states
- Integrates with comment system

## State Management Strategy

### Hybrid State Architecture
```
App State (Existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ YouTube Data (preserve)
â”œâ”€â”€ API Quota (preserve)
â””â”€â”€ User Preferences (preserve)

tldraw Store
â”œâ”€â”€ Canvas Elements (shapes, drawings)
â”œâ”€â”€ Tool States (selection, active tool)
â””â”€â”€ Viewport (camera, zoom)

State Bridge
â”œâ”€â”€ Sync selected thumbnails â†” tldraw selection
â”œâ”€â”€ Tool state coordination
â””â”€â”€ History integration
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Install tldraw and basic setup
2. Create custom ThumbnailShape
3. Implement YouTube thumbnail rendering
4. Basic selection and interaction

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
1. Text labels as tldraw text shapes
2. Comment pins as custom shapes
3. Basic drawing tool integration
4. State bridge implementation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
1. Layered drawing system
2. Performance badge overlays
3. Locked thumbnail states
4. Keyboard shortcut integration

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Week 7-8)
1. Performance optimization
2. Tool state coordination
3. History system integration
4. Testing and bug fixes

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk ðŸ”´
- **Performance**: May not match current PixiJS optimization
- **Drawing Layers**: Complex layer management implementation
- **State Sync**: Bridging two different state systems

### Medium Risk ðŸŸ¡
- **Custom Shapes**: Learning curve for complex shapes
- **Tool Integration**: Adapting existing tool patterns
- **YouTube Features**: Preserving all current functionality

### Low Risk ðŸŸ¢
- **Basic Canvas**: Pan, zoom, selection work well
- **Text System**: Good mapping to tldraw text
- **UI Integration**: React components remain unchanged

## Benefits of Migration

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Benefits
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminate custom canvas event handling
- **Better Collaboration**: Built-in multiplayer support
- **Improved State Management**: Robust undo/redo system
- **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized canvas rendering
- **Future-Proof**: Active development and community

### ðŸ“ˆ Long-term Benefits
- **Easier Maintenance**: Less custom canvas code
- **New Features**: Built-in tools and interactions
- **Better Testing**: More predictable state management
- **Scalability**: Handle larger documents efficiently

## Recommendation

**Proceed with hybrid migration** for the following reasons:
1. tldraw can handle 80% of current functionality with less code
2. Custom shapes provide flexibility for YouTube-specific features
3. Built-in collaboration opens new possibilities
4. Reduced maintenance burden for canvas code
5. Better development experience with React-first approach

The migration is **feasible but requires significant custom development** for YouTube-specific features. The hybrid approach allows preserving functionality while gaining tldraw's benefits.
