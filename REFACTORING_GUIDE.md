# Canvas Component Refactoring Guide

## Overview

The original `FigmaStyleCanvasSimple.jsx` component (900+ lines) has been refactored into smaller, modular components for better maintainability. All functionality has been preserved while improving code organization.

## Component Structure

### UI Components (`/src/components/canvas/`)

1. **CommentPin.jsx** - Individual comment pin with hover bubble
   - Displays comment pin marker
   - Shows comment details on hover
   - Handles resolve/delete actions

2. **CommentDialog.jsx** - Comment creation dialog
   - Text input for new comments
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to submit, Esc to cancel)

3. **CommentToolbar.jsx** - Bottom toolbar for comment mode
   - Toggle comment mode button
   - Comment count display

4. **CommentModeIndicator.jsx** - Top indicator when in comment mode
   - Shows active comment mode status
   - Provides quick exit button

5. **SidebarAnalytics.jsx** - Right sidebar for thumbnail analytics
   - Thumbnail preview
   - Performance metrics (views, likes, comments)

6. **ThumbnailCountSelector.jsx** - Dropdown for selecting thumbnail count
   - Options from 10 to 50 thumbnails

7. **SelectionIndicator.jsx** - Shows multi-selection count
   - Appears when multiple thumbnails selected

### Utility Modules

1. **ThumbnailRenderer.js** - PixiJS thumbnail creation
   - `createThumbnailContainer()` - Creates PixiJS container for thumbnail
   - `setupThumbnailInteractions()` - Adds hover, selection, and drag handlers

2. **CanvasControls.js** - Canvas interaction logic
   - `drawGrid()` - Renders background grid
   - `setupCanvasControls()` - Sets up pan, zoom, and keyboard shortcuts

### Main Component

**FigmaStyleCanvasRefactored.jsx** - Main orchestrator component
- Manages all state
- Initializes PixiJS application
- Coordinates between all subcomponents

## State Management

All state remains in the main component to maintain simplicity:
- `thumbnailCount` - Number of thumbnails to display
- `selectedIds` - Set of selected thumbnail IDs
- `thumbnailPositions` - Saved positions after dragging
- `comments` - Array of comment objects
- `isAddingComment` - Comment mode flag
- `viewportTransform` - Current pan/zoom state

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability** - Components can be easily reused or modified independently
3. **Maintainability** - Smaller files are easier to understand and debug
4. **Type Safety** - Better prop definitions for each component
5. **Testing** - Individual components can be unit tested

## Migration Notes

To use the refactored version:
1. Import from `FigmaStyleCanvasRefactored` instead of `FigmaStyleCanvasSimple`
2. All functionality remains identical
3. A toggle is provided in App.js to switch between versions

## Future Enhancements

Consider these additional improvements:
1. Extract comment state management into a custom hook
2. Add TypeScript definitions
3. Implement React.memo for performance optimization
4. Add unit tests for individual components
5. Consider using a state management library for complex state
